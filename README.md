# BareSSH Docs

This repo contains documentation and knowledge dumps for the BareSSH RCOS
project. Mostly, it includes guides on how to replicate some of the things we
did, and general information that might be useful in the future.

Most of the work we've done so far has been getting a TCP/IP stack to work on the board and learning about networking and embedded systems.
